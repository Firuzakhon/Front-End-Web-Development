Front-End Web Development

Front-End Web Development 
This is my first project. I am creating a website for a family owned bussiness. It is a trucking company that
has more than 15 trucks and refrigerators. This company also has a dispatcher service for truck owners.
It is also has a link that lets people apply for jobs. My website is responsive using Bootstrap.

To run this project, download the project as a ZIP file from Github, extract it into a working folder on your
machine, then open a browser on the index.html file.

The "Main" page of the site has a navigation links to where you want  to explore. 

The "About Us" page is mostly about the company history, the team, and our founders. This page has an image carousel that uses JavaScript.

The "Contact" page has an address, and also it has a form where you can ask us a question. When the user
clicks on the "Submit" button, a jQuery function will trigger an alert message.
