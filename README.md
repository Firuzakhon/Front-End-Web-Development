Front-End Web Development
This is my first project. I am creating a website for a family owned bussiness. It is a trucking company that has more than 15 trucks and refrigerators. Also, this company has a dispatcher service for truck owners. It has a link that lets people to apply for a job.
My website is responsive using a Bootstrap.
To run this project, download the project as a ZIP file from Github, and extract it into a working folder on your machine. Then open a browser on the index.html file.
Main page of the site is like a navigation. That you choose what are you interested first to explore. 
About Us page is mostly about the history, team, and our founders. This page has a Carousel using JavaScript. It was the hardest thing for me to understand JavaScript, and I am still need to work on JavaScript. I will definetly rewatch the videos and read more about JavaScript in August.  
Contact page has an address, and also it has a form where you can ask us a question. When the user clicks on submit button it has a Jquery function and an alert message is running.
